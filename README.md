# Student Regisitration Form
This registration page allows users to submit their Enrollment Number, First Name, Last Name, and Mobile Number through a clean and responsive web form. When the user clicks the submit button, the form data is sent to a backend server using JavaScript's fetch() function. The server, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, securely stores the submitted data in a database. A success message (toast) is displayed after submission, giving the user instant feedback without reloading the page. The date and time will also get stored in the database (insert time and update time).
